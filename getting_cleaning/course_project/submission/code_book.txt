THE ORIGINAL README FILE WITH THE RAW DATA IS AS FOLLOWS:

"The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years.
Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist.
Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration 
and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. 
The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. 
The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, 
where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data. 
The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters 
and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using 
a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, 
therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 
From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain. 
See 'features_info.txt' for more details. 


For each record it is provided:
======================================

- Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.
- Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope. 
- A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables. 
- Its activity label. 
- An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

The dataset includes the following files:
=========================================

- 'README.txt'
- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.
- 'features.txt': List of all features.

THE ORIGINAL FEATURES DOCUMENT MENTIONED IN THE README DOCUMENT IS AS FOLLOWS:

"Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc-XYZ and tGyro-XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc-XYZ and tGravityAcc-XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 
Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk-XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 
Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc-XYZ, fBodyAccJerk-XYZ, fBodyGyro-XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

tBodyAcc-XYZ
tGravityAcc-XYZ
tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
tBodyGyro-XYZ
tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
tBodyAccMag
tGravityAccMag

tBodyGyroMag
tBodyGyroJerkMag
fBodyAcc-XYZ
fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
fBodyGyro-XYZ
fBodyAccMag
fBodyAccJerkMag
fBodyGyroMag
fBodyGyroJerkMag

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
mad(): Median absolute deviation 
max(): Largest value in array
min(): Smallest value in array
sma(): Signal magnitude area
energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
iqr(): Interquartile range 
entropy(): Signal entropy
arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

gravityMean
tBodyAccMean
tBodyAccJerkMean
tBodyGyroMean
tBodyGyroJerkMean

The complete list of variables of each feature vector is available in 'features.txt'"


BELOW IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESSING WHICH THE "run_analysis.R" SCRIPT PERFORMS TO CLEAN THE RAW DATASET:

Firstly from the test folder all of the data from the files "subject_test.txt", "X_test.txt", and "y_test.txt"
was read in and column binded into a data frame called "test_df" with dimensions 2947x563. From the test folder 
the "Inertial Signals" folder was ignored and not used at all as none of its measurements were neccesary for the 
final tidy data set.

The columns of the "X_test" portion of the "test_df" were named by matching them appropriately with the second 
column of the "features.txt" file while the "y_test" column was names "labels" and the "subject_test" column was
named "SubjectId". 

After this a new column was created by reading in the "activity_labels.txt" file into a data frame and merging it 
with the "test_df" data frame based on "V1" and "labels" respectively.

The identical process was performed using the "train" folder with the only difference being the number of rows of the
"train_df" data frama and its formative files. The resulting "train_df" data frame had all of the same column names 
but had the dimensions 7352x564.

The "test_df" data frame was row binded to the bottom of the "train_df" data frame and the resulting data frame was 
assigned to "data_set". From "data_set" only the columns "SubjectId", "activity", and the columns whos names contained 
"mean" and "std" where selected and assigned again to "data_set". The columns containing "angle" were removed also.

In terms of cleaning column names:
- parenthesis were removed ()
- the typo "BodyBody" in some of thethe original dataset column names was replaced with just "Body"
- hypens were removed -
- "mean" was replaced with "Mean" for readability
- "std" was replaced with "Std" for readability
- All of the measurements where orignally "time domain signals" which was indicated in the original
data set by variables beginning with "t"... the only other type of variable beginning was "f" indicating
a Fast Fournier Transform (of some other time domain signal measurement). For readability the "t's" at the 
beginning of variables where removed leaving the "f's". Therefore any measurement variable which does not begin 
with an "f" is a time domain signal.

In terms of cleaning variable contents:
-the activity variables (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) where converted to 
lower case, the underscore removed, and the two word variables had the first letter of the second word capitalized 
resulting in: ("walking", "walkingUpstairs", "walkingDownstairs", "sitting", "standing", "laying")

Other changes to the data:

As indicated in the original documentation the measurements contained sensor signals from the accelerometer, and gyroscope
in a smartphone attached to the waist of 30 volunteers (aged 19-48) while they performed the six different "activites". Of 
all of these measurements we extracted only those which contained a mean value or a standard deviation (although excluding 
"angle" measurements which may have used another mean or standard deviation variable in their construction). For each
combination of subject (1 to 30) and activity we originally had many mean and standard deviation observations (between 38
and 95) but the final tidy dataset (final_set.txt) has just one observation for each combination of subject and activity.
These values are the mean value of the previous 38 to 95 observations. They are a "mean of means" or a "mean of standard 
deviations for each subject".

Final variables:

"activity" - character, containing ("walking", "walkingUpstairs", "walkingDownstairs", "sitting", "standing", "laying")                
"SubjectId" - integer, containing 1 to 30
-All of the variables below are numeric, and normalized and bounded between [-1, 1] as indicated in the original 
 data set README. As mentioned earlier in this code book, f indicateds a Fast Fournier Transform (as it did previously)
and all other variables with no "f" previously had a t infront, indicating they were time domain measurements. "Body", 
"Gravity", "Gyro", "Acc", "Jerk", "Mag", "Mean", "Std", "Freq", "X", "Y", and "Z" all are explained in the original 
documentation.
